Simulation-of-Chutes-and-Ladders

The game is simple. Players spin a spinner with number 1 through 6. Players move their piece that many spaces. Some spaces have ladders, and the player moves to a new location on the board. If you land at the bottom of a ladder, you move to the top of the ladder. Some spaces have chutes (slides) which causes the player to move backward. If you land at the top of a chute, you move to the bottom of the chute.
